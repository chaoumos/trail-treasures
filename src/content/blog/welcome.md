Hello World! This is your first post for Trail Treasures: Your Hiking Companion.
Based on your objective: "Create a website called 'Trail Treasures', a community platform for hikers. The primary focus is user-generated content: trail reviews, photos, maps, and difficulty ratings. Implement a map interface (using Leaflet or similar) to display trails visually. Users should be able to create accounts, upload content, and interact with other hikers. The site's aesthetic should be outdoorsy and inviting, using earth tones and natural imagery. Include sections for 'Recent Trails', 'Top Rated Trails', and a user profile page. The design should be responsive and mobile-friendly.", this site is ready for more content!
